			<h2>Why The Album Is Important</h2>

			<p>This album was one of the earliest and most popular albums of the grunge movement, released before Nirvana's "Nevermind" made the movement massively popular. The album was very influential toward alternative music and had the strongest classic rock influences out of the other big grunge groups. For me, this album is very nostalgic as it was played often around my house while growing up.</p>
