			<h2>Why The Album Is Important</h2>

			<p>This album is important because it combined Irish roots music with rock music and has a great atmosphere. Songs like "Where The Streets Have No Name" have a huge sound that make them memorable and help tell a story. To me, this album is very nostalgic since it's one of my dad's favorite albums, and therefore acts as a soundtrack to my childhood.</p>
